## Multiple choice: for each question, list the letter corresponding
## to the correct answer.  If more than one answer is correct, separate
## letters by a single comma (,)

#1) B
#2) A
#3) B,D
#4) B

#Notes: 

#3) Linux was not created until 1991, so A was not an event "in the
#same decade", I took off one point if this answer was given along
#with either B or D.  While C did in fact happen, it likely did not
#contribute to the eventual success of Unix and if anything, would
#have contributed to its demise if it hadn't been for B and D.
