* Introduction
** fork/exec
*** fork
- creates a new process, duplicating the calling process
- check return value to determine if in child or parent
*** exec
- a family of system calls
- replace current process image with a new process image

* Exercises
** experimentation
*** Are signal handlers preserved across a =fork=? What about an =exec=? 
*** What happens if you try to handle =SIGKILL=?
*** What is the behavior of global and local variables in child processes? 
- Are either preserved across an =exec=?
*** What about open file descriptors?
- across =fork=?
- across =exec=?
- can more than one process have an open file descriptor to the same file at one time?
*** What happens to a child process if it terminates or is killed before the parent calls =wait= on it?
*** What happens if the child process calls =fork()=?
*** Send SIGUSR1 to the process group associated with =fork_demo= several times, what happens? Why?
*** Send SIGUSR1 to the process group associated with =forkexec= several times, what happens? Why?
** modification
*** Using =forkexec= as a template
- copy into your =week14= git repo directory
- accept command line arguments, the first will be an integer, the next will be path to an executable program, the remaining will be arguments to pass to the executable.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
$ ./forkexec 3 ./child arg1 arg2
#+END_EXAMPLE

should spawn three =child= programs, each with an argument array:
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
['./child', 'arg1', 'arg2']
#+END_EXAMPLE

** submit
*** =ece2524.ece.vt.edu:inclass/CREATOR/week14.git=
- =README= :: response to however many questions you were able to discuss
- =CONTRIBUTORS= :: file containing a list of the git users who took part in the discussion
