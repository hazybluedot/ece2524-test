* Goals
** Apply the Unix Philosophy
*** Small is Beautiful
*** Make each program do one thing well
*** Build a prototype as soon as possible
*** Choose portability/transparency over efficiency
*** Store data in flat text files
*** Use software leverate to your advantage
*** Use shell scripts to increase leverage and portability
*** Avoid captive user interfaces
*** Make every program a filter

** Something you're interested in
*** Interested in learning
*** Interested in creating

** Components
*** Design
*** Make
*** Review
*** Write

* Ideas
** Considerations
*** Must be something that can be easily tested, evaluated by anyone with access to a *nix environment
- no special hardware requirements
- avoid dependencies on external data that require an account signup

*** Must implement core functionality as a command line utility without Qt dependancies
- A Qt-powered GUI may be included if implemented as a server/client framework

** Past Projects
*** text based adventure game

** Extension Projects
*** Simple Shell (extends upcoming fork/exec assignment)


** Meta Projects
*** Dynamic Midterm generator
- pull random questions from a pool
- compare output to reference at runtime to optionally provide live feedback

*** git managed static site generator for ECE2524 resources
- enable users to contribute via fork and pull request
- 

*** Framework for reviewing lots of source files


* Timeline
